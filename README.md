# Salesforce CLI MCP (Model Context Protocol)

> 🚀 A powerful MCP server that brings Salesforce CLI capabilities to AI assistants like Cursor.

This project provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants to interact with Salesforce organizations through the Salesforce CLI. It exposes various Salesforce operations as tools that can be used by AI models to query data, inspect metadata, deploy changes, run tests, and more.

## 🎯 What is this?

This MCP server provides a comprehensive set of tools that enable AI assistants to autonomously integrate with Salesforce organizations and iteratively solve complex tasks. Acting as a bridge between AI (like Cursor or VS Code Copilot) and your Salesforce orgs, it hepls with:

- 📊 Query Salesforce data using natural language
- 🔍 Inspect org schemas and metadata
- 📦 Deploy metadata to Salesforce orgs
- ✅ Run Apex tests and view coverage
- 🔐 Authenticate and manage multiple orgs
- 📈 Check org limits and usage
- 🤖 Iterate and chain multiple operations to solve complex tasks autonomously

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **[Setup Guide](./docs/SETUP.md)** - Install dependencies, Salesforce CLI, build the server, and configure environment
2. **[MCP Tools Testing](./docs/MCP_TOOLS_TESTING.md)** - Test the MCP tools interactively with the MCP Inspector
3. **[Cursor Setup](./docs/CURSOR_SETUP.md)** - Configure and use in Cursor
4. **[VS Code Setup](./docs/VSCODE_SETUP.md)** - Configure and use in VS Code (CoPilot)

> ℹ️ **Tip:** Configure your MCP client to run the compiled server (`npm run build` + `node build/index.js`). Running the source directly with `tsx` executes whatever git branch is checked out, so switching branches silently changes the server's behavior — see the troubleshooting section of the setup guides.
